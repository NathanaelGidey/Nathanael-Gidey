# Instructions in brief
This exercise gives an overview of the GitHub workflow I encourage you to use in this course.

Complete instructions are provided in a PDF in Brightspace. The main steps are:

1. Set up git
2. Clone this origin repository
3. Create and check out a feature branch; do the "work" described
4. Add the new file to the repository tracking
5. Commit your work with a comment
6. Pull the **main** branch from upstream
7. Merge the upstream **main** into your branch, resolving any conflicts
8. Push your feature branch to origin
9. Create a pull request to merge your feature back into **main**, assigning our TA to "review".
10. When you're asked to review someone's pull request, please do.

Copy the git command output to the assignment to finish your submission.
